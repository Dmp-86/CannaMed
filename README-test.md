# CANNAMED


CannaMed is a static front-end site that provides information and guidance on medical cannabis in the UK. 
The site will be targeted toward potential patients and anyone wishing to further their knowledge on the subject.
CannaMed will be useful for anyone who wants to look at Cannabis as an alternative treatment method for long-term conditions and anyone considering applying for a private prescription in the UK.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

- `#000000` used for primary text/main body and header.
- `#114611` used for secondary and headings.
- `#a8a7e6` used for highlighting blockquotes.
- `#a7e4a7` used for background of main information sections. 
- `#b1fdb1` used for highlighting list items in conditions section. 
- `#b1fdb1` used for background of main areas. 


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/a7e4a7-b1fdb1-63e069-008000-114611-a8a7e6-4a4a4f-3a3a3a) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography


- [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and icongraphy within headings. 

## Features


### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**

Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Contact page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation and consistentency in design aesthetics.
This section will enable the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
The navigation bar converts to a hamburger icon with a dropdown menu on screen-sizes of 750px and below. The menu is accessed by pressing the hamburger icon. This allows the content to fit in a structured manner on smaller devices.

- **The hero image & hero cover**

The hero section includes an image to display the main site content and some cover text to briefly describe the subject matter found on the site. The main hero image uses a high resolution image of a cannabis plant under full spectrum light. The colors of the image serve as a break to the standard green palette used across the site. This is intended to capture attention and provide visual indication of the subject matter. 
The section uses a zoom feature to highlight the image for users. Included on top of the image, is a cover box with the name of the site and a brief description.
