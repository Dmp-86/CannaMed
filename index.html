            <h2>Plant History <i class="fa-solid fa-cannabis"></i></h2>   
            <p>Cannabis has a long standing history of beneficial uses. Ancient cultures didn’t grow the plant for its psychoactive properties. They did, however, use it as herbal medicine and it's uses date back to 6000BC.
                Political influence and racial factors in the early 20th century led to the criminalisation and prohibition of Cannabis across the globe.  
                Sir William Brooke O’Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor studying in India, found that cannabis extracts could help significantly reduce stomach pain and vomiting in patients with cholera.
                By the end of 1800s, cannabis products were available in pharmacies and doctors’ offices across Europe and the US to treat stomach problems and other ailments.
                Cannabis, as a substance,  remains a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. 
                However, changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in November 2018 do allow medicinal cannabis products to be prescribed under certain circumstances and for specific conditions/symptoms.

            <p>Am I eligible?
                Medical Cannabis cannot be prescribed by a GP, however your GP can refer you to a specialist doctor who can legally prescribe the medication. 
                Given the restrictive nature of these referrals, the only realistic way to access medical cannabis is through a priivate prescription with a specialist. 

                The specialist doctor will assess patients on an individual basis, and will require some proof that you meet the eligibility criteria based on the condition that you would like to treat and previous medication use.  
                By law, a medical cannabis prescription can only be given out <em>“when the patient has an unmet special clinical need that cannot be met by licensed products”.</em>
                That means that patients will need to pursue other forms of treatment before being able to try prescribed medical cannabis. 
                Products such as CBD or hemp oil can be sold legally as food supplements and are not subject to the same laws as medical cannabis.
