            <hr>
            <p>Cannabis has a long standing history of beneficial uses. <br>Ancient cultures didn’t grow the plant for
                its psychoactive properties.<br>
                They did, however, use it as herbal medicine and it's uses date back to 6000BC.<br>
                Political influence and racial factors in the early 20th century led to the criminalisation and
                prohibition of Cannabis across the globe. <br>
                Sir William Brooke O’Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor studying in India, found that cannabis extracts could
                help significantly reduce stomach pain and vomiting in patients with cholera.<br>
                By the end of 1800s, cannabis products were available in pharmacies and doctors’ offices across Europe
                and the US.
                <br>The medicinal properties of cannabis were seen to treat stomach problems and other ailments with
                great success.
                <br>
                Cannabis, as a substance, remains a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. <br>
                However, recent changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in November 2018 do allow medicinal cannabis
                products to be prescribed under certain circumstances and for specific conditions/symptoms.<br> </p>

        <div class="start">

            <p>
                <u><strong>Where do I start?</strong></u>
                <br>
                Medical Cannabis cannot be prescribed by a GP, however your GP can refer you to a specialist doctor who
                can legally prescribe the medication.
                <br>Given the restrictive nature of these referrals, the only realistic way to access medical cannabis
                for most is through a private prescription with a specialist. <br>
                The specialist doctor will assess patients on an individual basis, and will require some proof that you
                meet the eligibility criteria based on the condition that you would like to treat and previous
                medication use. <br>
                By law, a medical cannabis prescription can only be given out
                <q><strong>
                        ..when the patient has an unmet special clinical need that cannot be met by licensed products.
                    </strong></q>
                <br>
                That means that patients will need to pursue other forms of treatment before being able to try
                prescribed medical cannabis.
                <br> Once this is documented in medical records, you can take your first step towards finding a clinic
                that suits your needs.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="step-2-p">
                <u><strong>How do I prepare?</strong></u>

                <br>
                Before you attend your first consultation at a medical cannabis clinic, you will be asked for access to
                medical record information.<br>
                This is to ensure that you are eligible for treatment with cannabis medications. <br>
                Once your doctor has confirmed eligibility, they will assess the best type of medication and mode of
                delivery for you based on your medical history. <br>
                To expedite the process, it’s useful to contact your GP in preparation and request a copy of your
                Summary Care Record (SCR). This is a high-level overview of active conditions and medications, and
                should be accessible to all patients in the UK/NI. <br>


                <!-- <strong>Included in the SCA:</strong><br> -->
                <!-- <ul>
            <li>
                Any current medication(s)
            </li>
           
            <li>
                Allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Your name, address, date of birth, and NHS number
            </li>
        </ul> -->
                If your SCR is missing key diagnostic info or medications, you can request a referral letter from your
                GP or consultant.<br>
                The key requirement is that you must provide a confirmed diagnosis of one or more qualifying conditions.
                <br>
                Clinic staff are always on hand to assist with this journey and answer any questions you may have. <br>

                <u><strong>Initial Consultation</strong></u>
                <br>
                Once your medical records have been shared, you will attend an assessment consultation with someone from
                your chosen clinic (either via video-call or face-to-face).

                <br>
                The consultant will discuss any previous cannabis use (for medicinal purposes) and what effects you
                experienced.
                <br>
                These questions are set to ensure that cannabis is the right choice for you.
                <br>
                In some instances, your case may also be discussed with a multidisciplinary team.
                <br>
                This allows your consultant the opportunity to get a better sense of how the medication may affect your
                condition moving forward.
                <br>
                <em>You have the right to request any information discussed be kept off your records.</em><br>
                If you have any concerns, questions, or fears about the process or about your cannabis prescription in
                general, this is the time to ask them.<br>
                It’s recommended to take notes during your consultation so that you have a reference point of everything
                that is discussed.

            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Are the drugs prescribed at the clinics legal?</strong><br>
                Yes. All of the medication we prescribe is fully legal and regulated. <br>
                The use of medical cannabis within the UK was made legal as of 1 November 2018 provided it is
                prescribed by a medical specialist who has taken into account the current evidence and guidelines
                alongside your particular diagnoses and conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>How do I know if medical cannabis can help me?</strong><br>
                Medical cannabis can be used to treat a variety of conditions where other medications and treatments
                have failed. <br>
                Patients suffering from chronic pain, neuropathy and psychiatric conditions have found benefits.<br>
                To be eligible to consider medical cannabis treatment, you need to have tried 2 other treatments
                that have not worked. <br>
                You also must not suffer from psychosis or schizophrenia.<br>
                If you are not sure if you would benefit from medical cannabis, we recommend either:<br>
                <em>- Speak to a patient coordinator today for free to learn more and understand how it all
                    works<br>
                    - Get booked in with a consultant so they can assess your condition and suitability for
                    treatment</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Is medical cannabis addictive?</strong><br>
                Medical Cannabis that contains higher amounts of THC carries a small risk of habituation and
                addiction if used daily for chronic use, but the risk is lower than with other classes of
                medications such as opioid pain medications and possibly lower than benzodiazepines for anxiety and
                sleep.<br>
                Your medical cannabis specialist will monitor you closely for signs of addiction to minimize this
                risk and choose specific products with lower risk appropriate for your symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>How do you choose what products will work best?</strong><br>
                Our team of doctors are experts in treating patients with medical cannabis and will choose your
                treatment after a comprehensive assessment. <br>
                Your doctor will review your symptoms, current medications, the pattern of your symptoms and
                lifestyle factors.<br>
                They will also monitor and adjust the medication on a regular basis to ensure the best effect with
                fewest side effects.
