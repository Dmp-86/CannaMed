            <h2>Plant History <i class="fa-solid fa-cannabis"></i></h2>   
            <p>Cannabis has a long standing history of beneficial uses. Ancient cultures didn’t grow the plant for its psychoactive properties. They did, however, use it as herbal medicine and it's uses date back to 6000BC.
                Political influence and racial factors in the early 20th century led to the criminalisation and prohibition of Cannabis across the globe.  
                Sir William Brooke O’Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor studying in India, found that cannabis extracts could help significantly reduce stomach pain and vomiting in patients with cholera.
                By the end of 1800s, cannabis products were available in pharmacies and doctors’ offices across Europe and the US to treat stomach problems and other ailments.
                Cannabis, as a substance,  remains a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. 
                However, changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in November 2018 do allow medicinal cannabis products to be prescribed under certain circumstances and for specific conditions/symptoms.

            <h2>Patient Journey <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-user"></i></i></h2>
            <p><h4>Where do I start?</h4>
                Medical Cannabis cannot be prescribed by a GP, however your GP can refer you to a specialist doctor who can legally prescribe the medication. 
                Given the restrictive nature of these referrals, the only realistic way to access medical cannabis is through a priivate prescription with a specialist. 
                The specialist doctor will assess patients on an individual basis, and will require some proof that you meet the eligibility criteria based on the condition that you would like to treat and previous medication use.  
                By law, a medical cannabis prescription can only be given out <em>“when the patient has an unmet special clinical need that cannot be met by licensed products”.</em>
                That means that patients will need to pursue other forms of treatment before being able to try prescribed medical cannabis. 
                Once this is documented in medical records, you can take your first step towards finding a clinic that suits your needs. 
           </p>
           <p><h4>How do I prepare?</h4>
            Before you attend your first consultation at a medical cannabis clinic, you will be asked for access to medical record information. 
            This is to ensure that you are eligible for treatment with cannabis medications. 
            Once your doctor has confirmed eligibility, they will assess the best type of medication and mode of delivery for you based on your medical history. 

            To expedite the process, it’s useful to contact your GP in preparation and request a copy of your Summary Care Record (SCR). This is a high-level overview of active conditions and medications, and should be accessible to all patients in the UK/NI. 
            Included in the SCA:<br>
            
            Any current medication(s)<br>
            Allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines<br>
            Your name, address, date of birth, and NHS number<br>

            If your SCR is missing key diagnostic info or medications, you can request a referral letter from your GP or consultant. 
            The key requirement is that you must provide a confirmed diagnosis of one or more qualifying conditions. 
            Clinic staff are always on hand to assist with this journey and answer any questions you may have. <br>
            <h4>Initial Consultation</h4>
            Once your medical records have been shared, you will attend an assessment consultation with someone from your chosen clinic (either via video-call or face-to-face). 
            
            Assessment questions will cover:<br>
            - what treatments you have tried in the past<br>
            - challenges/restrictions you faced with these treatments <br>
            - what symptoms you ar experiencing<br>
            - how your condition affects your day-to-day life <br>
            
            The consultant will discuss any previous cannabis use (for medicinal purposes) and what effects you experienced. 
            These questions are set to ensure that cannabis is the right choice for you. 
            
            In some instances, your case may also be  discussed with a multidisciplinary team. 
            This allows your consultant the opportunity to get a better sense of how the medication may affect your condition moving forward. 
            <em>You have the right to request any information discussed be kept off your records</em>
            
            If you have any concerns, questions, or fears about the process or about your cannabis prescription in general, this is the time to ask them.
            
            It’s recommended to take notes during your consultation so that you have a reference point of everything that is discussed.
