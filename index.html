            <h2>Plant History <i class="fa-solid fa-cannabis"></i></h2>   
            <p>Cannabis has a long standing history of beneficial uses. Ancient cultures didn’t grow the plant for its psychoactive properties. They did, however, use it as herbal medicine and it's uses date back to 6000BC.
                Political influence and racial factors in the early 20th century led to the criminalisation and prohibition of Cannabis across the globe.  
                Sir William Brooke O’Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor studying in India, found that cannabis extracts could help significantly reduce stomach pain and vomiting in patients with cholera.
                By the end of 1800s, cannabis products were available in pharmacies and doctors’ offices across Europe and the US to treat stomach problems and other ailments.
                Cannabis, as a substance,  remains a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation. 
                However, changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in November 2018 do allow medicinal cannabis products to be prescribed under certain circumstances and for specific conditions/symptoms.

            <h2>Patient Journey <i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-user"></i></i></h2>
            <p>Where do I start?<br>
                Medical Cannabis cannot be prescribed by a GP, however your GP can refer you to a specialist doctor who can legally prescribe the medication. 
                Given the restrictive nature of these referrals, the only realistic way to access medical cannabis is through a priivate prescription with a specialist. 
                The specialist doctor will assess patients on an individual basis, and will require some proof that you meet the eligibility criteria based on the condition that you would like to treat and previous medication use.  
                By law, a medical cannabis prescription can only be given out <em>“when the patient has an unmet special clinical need that cannot be met by licensed products”.</em>
                That means that patients will need to pursue other forms of treatment before being able to try prescribed medical cannabis. Once this is documented in medical records, you can take your first step towards finding a clinic that suits your needs. 
           </p>
           <p>When you first talk with someone from a medical cannabis clinic, you will be asked to share access to your medical records. 
            This is to ensure that you have a condition that entitles you to a cannabis prescription and enables the medical professionals to find the right program for you down the line.

            To speed up the process, it’s a good idea to contact your GP ahead of time and request a copy of your Summary Care Record (SCR), which includes, at a minimum:
            
            Any current medication(s)
            Allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines
            Your name, address, date of birth, and NHS number
            If a diagnosis of the condition that entitles you to a cannabis prescription is not included in your SCR, you can also request a referral letter from your GP. 
            The key requirement is that you must provide a confirmed diagnosis of one or more qualifying conditions. 
            If you are uncertain about any part of this, the clinic will likely be able to assist you.
            
            Once your medical records have been shared, you will need to require a consultation with someone from your chosen clinic. 
            This will either be in person or via a video call and your consultant will conduct an assessment with you.
            
            Questions within the assessment will cover what treatments you might have tried in the past, why they haven’t worked, what symptoms from your condition you are experiencing, and how your condition is affecting your life day-to-day.
            
            The consultant will also likely ask if you’ve used cannabis for medicinal purposes before and what the effects were. 
            All of these questions are to identify whether cannabis is the right course of action for you.
            
            In some cases, your case may also be presented and discussed with a multidisciplinary team, to get a full sense of how the treatment may affect you and your condition moving forward. 
            Remember that you have the right for anything you discussed to be left off your records if you would like to.
            
            This is not only the time for your consultant to get to know you but also for you to get to know your chosen clinic. 
            If you have any concerns, questions, or fears about the process or about your cannabis prescription in general, this is the time to ask them.
            
            It’s a good idea to take notes throughout your consultation so that you have all the information discussed to hand later on. 
            Lots of topics may be discussed, so it’s easy to forget some points later on.</p>
